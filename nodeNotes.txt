node Notes

For help with node:

man npm node

need to look up:
 nom-init 
for help with my package.json file.

    docs        npm docs <pkgname>
                npm docs .

 

doing learnyousome node by typing learnyounode in Terminal

var fs = require('fs');

var buffer = fs.readFile(process.argv[2], function(err, data){
if (err) throw err;
return data
}

);

var stingy = buffer.toString();

console.log(stingy.split('\n').length-1)

mich st postgame: 


var fs = require('fs');
var path = process.argv[2];

fs.readFile(path, 'utf8', function(err,data) {
  var lines = data.split('\n');
  console.log(lines.length-1);
});


For learnyounode Filtered LS I need to remember that the file ext I want to filter by is in process.argv[3]



Comparison operators are a fancy(not realy) shorthand for if else statements that real developers use i guess when there’s just 2 things. or maybe you can do multiple.
